Are you tired to start Origin, wait for its loading, then open the browser, navigate to the Battlelog, login, and then search for a server?
Just for you here it comes BFDesktop.
It is an application that loads Origin for you, auto-logs you in the Battlelog and make your soldier life much simpler :smile:.

## How it works?
It's an [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) app, it is just a webview of the Battlelog but with some tweaks.
It opens Origin and if you set the option Auto-Login to ON in the app menu it will log you automatically.

## First start
When you open the app for the first time, you must do the login as you do in your browser, 
then when you are logged you must swith ON the radio button in the Auto-Login menu (see below the screen).

Then you have finished, you can start playing, you can quit the app and reopen it to see the auto-login magic..

## How to quit the app
When you click the cross in the upper right corner, the app will minimize in the tray(it will use less RAM).
If you want to really quit the app, you must right click the app icon in the tray and select "exit" (see below the screen).

But the best thing, in my opinion is left it open.

## Which Games are supported?
BF3 ![3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naramsim/BF4-Desktop-App/dev/media/bf3.png),
BF4 ![3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naramsim/BF4-Desktop-App/dev/media/bf4.png),
BFH ![3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naramsim/BF4-Desktop-App/dev/media/bfh.png)

You can select the default Battlelog that will load by checking it in the upper left menu "BF?".
And the best thing is that the app will remember which game you are using.
