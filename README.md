Are you tired of starting Origin, waiting for it to load, open your browser, navigate to the Battlelog, login, and finally search for a server?
BFDesktop takes care of this.
This app loads Origin and auto-logs you in the Battlelog, making your life as a soldier much simpler :smile:.

## How does it work?
Based on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), it is a simple webview of the Battlelog, with some tweaks.
Not only it opens Origin on its own, but setting the Auto-Login option to ON it will also log you into Battlelog automatically.

## First start
As you open the app for the first time, you must login as you normally do in your browser, 
then while logged in you can set the radio button to ON in the Auto-Login menu (see the screenshot below).

You can now start playing, then quit the app and every time you reopen it you are going to see the auto-login magic!

## How to quit the app
Clicking the red cross in the upper right hand corner will simply minimize the app in the tray (with less RAM usage).
If you want to completely quit the app, you have to right click the app icon in the tray and select "exit" (see the screenshot below).

In my opinion it is best left open though!

## Which games are supported?
BF3 ![3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naramsim/BF4-Desktop-App/dev/media/bf3.png),
BF4 ![3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naramsim/BF4-Desktop-App/dev/media/bf4.png),
BFH ![3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naramsim/BF4-Desktop-App/dev/media/bfh.png)

You can select which game's Battlelog loads by defauly by selecting it in the upper left menu "BF?".
The app will always remember which game you are using.
